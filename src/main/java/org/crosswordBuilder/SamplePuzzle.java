    -1 is a blacked out space
    0 is an empty space (this will on appear in these solved puzzles

    Do i store both a soltion set and an empt puzzle
    Or do i store an unsolved puzzle and then the clues that it follows
    how do i store the clues?
    accross clues
    down clues
    nope easier to just store a solved puzzle
    so this puzzle library will store copies of solved puzzles that will then be "cleared"
    when they are loaded in
